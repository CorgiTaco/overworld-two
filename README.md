# Overworld 2
"If the overworld is so good, why isn't there an overworld 2??"

This mod implements an alternative world generator that replicates the style of vanilla overworld generation while bringing improvements to performance.
Unfortunately, to allow more invasive optimization, parity with vanilla is not maintained.
